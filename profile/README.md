#### Core Data Structure
- Regular Data structure: List, Stack, Queue, Priority Queue (taken from gods)
- [Systems Data structure](https://github.com/csorchard/sds):
  - Hash-Based: Bloom Filter, Count Min Sketch, HyperLogLog
  - Sorted: BTree, Binary Search Tree, Treap
  - Distributed Hash: Consistent Hashing, ChordDHT, Range Based Partitioning, Extendable Hashing

#### Misc
- Tree: Red Black Tree,
- Hash:
- Storage Engine: WAL, Btree, CoW Btree, LSM Tree
- Memtable using Skip List
- Merkal Tree
- B Epsilon Tree
- K-D tree
- Z-Index: storage optimization
- Cuckoo filter
- Reservoir Sampling
- Sliding window


#### Advanced Data Structures
- Arena based skip list
- Roaring BitMap
- Zone Map


#### Distributed Systems
- Consistent Hash
- Hash Wheel Timer
